It's a static site generator! And it's oddly specific AND inflexible?! Wow! I 
love it! Great code, awesome job! Code good! Code EXCELLENT!

But hey, maybe, just maybe (and only maybe), you'll find some useful tidbits 
of code to copy and paste?

You know what they say: Hippity Hoppity, your code is now my property!

I really don't care, go for it! Copy and paste all those bitflippin' 
tidbits! This IS The Internet, after all!

DISCLAIMER: The lawyers (haha ya I can afford those ya of course what 
do you mean) inform me that I need to disclose this code in no way 
utilizes bitflipping, and that I used "bitflippin'" as a swear word 
stand-in replacement. No bad words, absolutely no curse words! 
Oh jolly gee gosh!

THE CHIME-IN NOTE TO SELF: but what if the libraries this code 
uses utilizes bitflipping? Does that mean this code itself 
utilizes bitflipping in some way? Or does that not count 
since the bitflipping is utilized in a different codebase? 
Am I thinking about this too hard? Is the sky falling? 
What is the meaning of life? 42?! What am I even doing 
with my life by writing this pointless README.md 
file I didn't even need to write just because of a shiny green 
button? What is reality? 
What is love? Don't hurt me no more!!!
*goes to sleep for 16 hours, wakes up 
lookin' like dynamite, just not in the same
way as the song, out of touch and out of time 
like a 3D Pinball: Space Cadet, and takes a sip of warm fizzy 
sweetwater 7-Up or Sprite or Spritz-Up or something or other 
from a half-empty and/or half-full and/or half-life can*
I'm alright. Don't worry 'bout me. Just an
existential crisis, I have at least one of those a day.
It's fine. I'm fine. Good night, I'm going back to bed.
