It's a static site generator! And it's oddly specific AND inflexible?! Wow! I 
love it! Great code, awesome job! Code good! Code EXCELLENT!

But hey, maybe, just maybe (and only maybe), you'll find some useful tidbits 
of code to copy and paste?

You know what they say: Hippity Hoppity, your code is now my property!

I really don't care, go for it! Copy and paste all those bitflippin' 
tidbits! This IS The Internet, after all!

DISCLAIMER: The lawyers (haha ya I can afford those ya of course what 
do you mean) inform me that I need to disclose this code in no way 
utilizes bitflipping, and that I used "bitflippin'" as a swear word 
stand-in replacement. No bad words, absolutely no curse words! 
Oh jolly gee gosh!
